# ZEP 6 - A Zarr Object Model

Authors:

* Davis Bennett([@d-v-b](https://github.com/d-v-b))

Status: Draft

Type: Specification

Created: 2023-07-20


## Abstract

This ZEP defines Zarr Object Models, or ZOMs. A ZOM is a language-independent interface that describes an abstract Zarr hierarchy as a tree of nodes. ZOMs are parametrized by a particular Zarr version, so there is a ZOM for Zarr Version 2, which differs from the ZOM for Zarr V3.

The basic ZOM defines two types of nodes: arrays and groups. Both types of nodes have an `attributes` property, which is an object with string keys and arbitrary values. The base ZOM does not define the exact properties of arrays, as these properties vary with Zarr versions. In the base ZOM, groups have a property called `members`, which is an object with string keys and values that are either arrays or groups. This definition is designed to be abstract enough that it can be implemented by a range of programming languages, and expressed in a wide range of interchange formats.

The ZOM forms the basis for a declarative, type-safe approach to managing Zarr hierarchies. 

## Motivation and Scope

The Zarr specifications define models of arrays and groups; the Zarr specifications do not define models for hierarchies of arrays and groups. This is unfortunate, because many users of Zarr work primarily with structured hierarchies. 

For example, the python library `xarray` defines data structures that can be persisted to Zarr as a Zarr group containing one or more Zarr arrays with specific metadata. The full specification of this format can be found [here](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/internals/zarr-encoding-spec.html#zarr-encoding). For `xarray` (or any other application that works with structured hieararchies) to save data to Zarr, it must first create a compliant Zarr hierarchy. To read data from Zarr, `xarray` must first check if the potential source of data is an `xarray`-compliant Zarr hierarchy. 

Creating and validating Zarr hierarchies can be done procedurally, i.e. as a sequence of Zarr array and group access routines, or declaratively, as a hierarchy definition followed by a procedure that implements the definition. The latter is preferable, but it first requires a machine-readable data model for a Zarr hierarchy.

Such models should be sufficient to express the structure of a Zarr hierarchy, and these models must be usable by Zarr implementations as a basis for declarative APIs for creating and validating Zarr hierarchies. That is the central goal of this proposal.

## Definition of hierarchy structure

This document distinguishes the *structure* of a Zarr hierarchy from the data stored in the hierarchy. The structure of a Zarr hierarchy is the layout of the tree of arrays and groups, and the metadata of those arrays and groups. This definition omits the data stored in the arrays, and the particular storage backend used to store data and metadata. By these definitions, two distinct Zarr hierarchies can have the same structure even if their arrays contain different values, and / or the hierarchies are stored using different storage backends. 

Because the structure of a zarr hierarchy is decoupled, by definition, from the data stored in the hierarchy, it should be possible to represent the structure of a Zarr hierarchy with a compact data structure or interface. Such a data structure or interface would facilitate operations like evaluating whether two Zarr hierarchies are identically structured, evaluating whether a given Zarr hierarchy has a specific structure, or creating a Zarr hierarchy with a desired structure. This document formalizes the Zarr Object Model (ZOM), an abstract model of the structure of a Zarr hierarchy. The ZOM serves as a foundation for tools that create and manipulate Zarr hierarchies at a structural level.

## Specification of the base Zarr Object Model

We begin with a definition of a "base" Zarr Object Model. On its own, the base ZOM is not useful for working with actual Zarr hierarchies, because it contains a reference to an unspecified Zarr version. By supplying definitions from a particular Zarr version, we can specialize the base ZOM and produce an object that can be used for doing actual work. 

A node is an object with a property called `attributes`, which is a key-value data structure that contains content described as "arbitrary user metadata" in Zarr specifications. As of Zarr versions 2 and 3, `attributes` must be a JSON-serializable object with string keys.

The base ZOM defines exactly two types of node: groups and arrays. This definition will use the unqualified terms "array" and "group" to refer to the two nodes defined in the ZOM. Where necessary to avoid ambiguity, the objects *represented* by ZOM arrays and ZOM groups, i.e. Zarr arrays and Zarr groups, will be referred to as "Zarr arrays" and "Zarr groups".

ZOM arrays and ZOM groups represent Zarr arrays and Zarr groups in the simplest way possible that still conforms to the definition of "node" given above. Thus, a ZOM array is a node with properties identical to those defined in a particular specification of Zarr array metadata, unless one of those Zarr array properties contains user metadata, in which case a ZOM array does not include that property (since user metadata is already represented by the `attributes` property of the array). This definition is parametric with respect to a particular Zarr specification in order to accomodate future versions of Zarr that may add new properties to Zarr arrays.

Similarly, a ZOM group is a node with properties identical to those defined in a specification of Zarr group metadata, unless one of those properties contains user metadata, in which case a ZOM group does not contain that property, for the same reason given above for arrays. Beyond the properties of Zarr groups defined in a particular Zarr specification, a ZOM group has an additional property:

- `members`: a key-value data structure where the keys are the subset of strings that are permitted node names according to a particular Zarr specification, and the values are arrays or groups. This property allows a ZOM group to represent the hierarchical relationship between Zarr groups and the Zarr arrays or Zarr groups contained within them.

If future versions of Zarr use a property called `members` for some element of Zarr group metadata, then there would be a naming collision between the `members` property of a Zarr group and the `members` property of a ZOM group. In this case, the ZOM group would rename the Zarr group's `members` property to `_members`, and any additional name collisions would be resolved by prepending additional underscore ("_") characters. E.g., in the unlikely case that `members` and `_members` are *both* listed in Zarr group metadata, then the schema group representation would map the `members` property of the Zarr group to a property called `__members`.

Thus, ZOM groups and ZOM arrays can represent the structure of a Zarr hierarchy, per the description given in [#definition-of-hierarchy-structure].

### Zarr Object Models in JSON

The ZOM representation of a Zarr hierarchy can be easily represented as a JSON object. 

See below an example of a Zarr version 3 ZOM group representing a Zarr group that contains a single Zarr array. Both the Zarr group and the Zarr array contain user metadata.

```json
{
  "zarr_format": 3,
  "node_type": "group",
  "attributes": {
    "foo": 42,
    "bar": false
  },
  "members": {
    "array": {
      "zarr_format": 3,
      "node_type": "array",
      "attributes": {
        "baz": [
          1,
          2,
          3
        ]
      },
      "shape": [
        1000,
        1000
      ],
      "data_type": "|u1",
      "chunk_grid": {
        "name": "regular",
        "configuration": {
          "chunk_shape": [
            1000,
            100
          ]
        }
      },
      "chunk_key_encoding": {
        "name": "default",
        "configuration": {
          "separator": "/"
        }
      },
      "fill_value": 0,
      "codecs": [
        {
          "name": "GZip",
          "configuration": {
            "level": 1
          }
        }
      ],
      "storage_transformers": null,
      "dimension_names": [
        "rows",
        "columns"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

A similar hierarchy defined in Zarr V2 can also be represented as a ZOM group:

```json
{
  "zarr_format" : 2,
  "attributes": {
    "foo" : 42, 
    "bar" : false
    },
  "members": {
    "foo": {
      "zarr_format" : 2,
      "shape" : [1000, 1000],
      "chunks": [100, 100],
      "dtype": "|u1",
      "compressor": null,
      "fill_value": 0,
      "order": "C",
      "dimension_separator":  "/",
      "filters": {},
      "attributes" : {
        "baz": true
        }
    }
  }
}
```

### Zarr Object Models in JSON schema

A ZOM can also be represented as a JSON schema. Here is a the ZOM for Zarr V3 expressed as a JSON schema:

```

To facilitate adoption of new Zarr versions, it may be desirable to define a mapping from ZOM to ZOM, e.g. ZOM for Zarr v2 -> ZOM for Zarr v3. Programs could use such mappings to execute programmatic conversions of hierarchies to newer Zarr versions.

### Implementing consolidated metadata via Zarr Object Models

The time required to traverse large, deeply-nested Zarr hierarchies stored on high-latency backends (e.g., cloud storage) can be onerous for applications that consume Zarr containers. One solution to this problem is to consolidate the metadata for each node or group in the hierarchy into a document stored at the root of the hierarchy.
