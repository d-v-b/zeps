ZEP stands for Zarr Enhancement Proposal. A ZEP is a design document providing
information to the Zarr community, describing a modification or enhancement of
the [Zarr specifications](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a new
feature for its processes or environment. The ZEP should provide specific proposed
changes to the Zarr specification and a narrative rationale for the specification
changes.

We intend ZEPs to be the primary mechanism for evolving the spec, collecting
community input on major issues and documenting the design decision that has
gone into Zarr.

### ZEP Meetings üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

We hold bi-weekly ZEPs meetings to propose, discuss, review and finalize discussions around current ZEPs and Zarr Specification. More info available here: [https://zarr.dev/zeps/meetings/](https://zarr.dev/zeps/meetings/)
